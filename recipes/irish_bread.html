<img src="downloads/irish_bread.jpeg"><caption>Irish Soda Bread cut into slices.</caption>
<p>This is one of my favorite bread recipies because it doesn't
    require yeast to rise.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 cups raisins</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
    <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1¼ cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Grease a 9-inch round cast 
        iron skillet or a 9-inch round baking or cake pan.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour (reserving 1 tablespoon), 
        sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, raisins, and 
        caraway seeds. In a small bowl, blend eggs, buttermilk 
        and sour cream. Stir the liquid mixture into flour mixture 
        just until flour is moistened.</li>
    <li>Knead dough in bowl about 10 to 12 strokes. Dough will be 
        sticky. Place the dough in the prepared skillet or pan 
        and pat down. Cut a 4x¾-inch deep slit in the top of the 
        bread. Dust with reserved flour.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 65 to 75 minutes. Let cool 
        and turn bread onto a wire rack.</li>

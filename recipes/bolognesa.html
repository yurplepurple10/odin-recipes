        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup finely diced onion</li>
            <li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
            <li>½ cup finely diced carrot</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups 2% milk</li>
            <li>2 cups white wine</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
            <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium 
                heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, and 1 pinch salt; cook and 
                stir until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir ground beef into vegetables; cook and stir until meat 
                is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season with 
                1 1/2 teaspoons salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and black 
                pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. 
                Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the milk has 
                evaporated and the bottom of the pan is still slightly saucy, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high and pour in white wine; cook and 
                stir until wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl; 
                crush them with your hands until they resemble a chunky 
                sauce. Pour tomato mixture into ground beef mixture; 
                fill the tomato can with 2 cups water and stir into 
                sauce. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture 
                cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 
                4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from the top of sauce if desired. Add 
                more water if sauce is too thick. Taste and adjust seasonings 
                before serving.</li>
        </ol>
